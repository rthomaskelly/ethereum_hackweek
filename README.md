# Ethereum Hackweek
This repo contains examples to work with Ethereum Blockchain & Smart Contracts.

## Basic Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are the .sol files. They can be built with the build.sh script like this:

    $ ./build.sh my_smart_contract.sol

The build file (a JSON file) will be output to the build/ dir.

## More Basic Setup
Installing Ethereum, Solidity Compiler (solc) and an Ethereum client like Geth is shown in the `install_eth_solidity.sh` script.
